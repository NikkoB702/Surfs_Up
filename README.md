## Analysis

  For this project we conducted data analysis on weather conditions in Oahu, Hawaii to find out if our business model of surfing and eating ice cream is sustainable. Whether we decide on a seasonal proposal or operating year-round, weather conditions prove to be a vital statistic to observe to increase our chance for sunnier skies. The two variables we focused on were temperature and precipitation. Let’s take a deep dive!
  
## Results

  ###### Temperature
  
  ![June_temps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80132877/200050589-d28bbafe-eb9f-45be-b2b9-63bda70fef8f.png)![December_temps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80132877/200050604-bbbda2df-566a-4fe3-9bcc-94bd68169e8d.png)


  
    As we can see from the images shown, on average the temperature in June is just under 75° while the average temperature in December is just over 71°. That gives us roughly a 4° difference in average temperature between the two contrasting months. The standard deviation in June is 3.25 and 3.74 in December which suggests that December has a higher volatility in temperatures. When comparing the minimum temperature we see our biggest difference in the data, with June’s minimum temperature at 64° and December’s minimum temperature at 56°. This shouldn’t affect our decision to open shop considering is highly likely these data points were collected at night. Aside from that we see little variance between the range of temperatures collected in our corresponding months. 
    
   ##### Precipitation

    As we observe the images shown, we see some rather drastic differences between June and December. Let’s start with the mean, as December shows an inch increase in average precipitation over the month of June. The standard deviations are also vastly different, with December showing a much higher deviation than June. Finally let’s look at the maximum precipitation between the two, with December capped out at 6.4” and June 4.43” respectively. What this means is that we can expect heavier and more volatile precipitation in December compared to June.   
  
  
## Summary  

  While we compiled some key metrics to provide insight on our ambitions to own a Surf-n-Shake shop, other variables must be examined in order to round out our analysis. As we learned, temperatures don’t vary too much from month to month, however precipitation is something we should consider when building the infrastructure of our operations. Other weather-related variables to examine are wind conditions and surf conditions. It’s fair to say ahead of time that the location of our shop comparative to surf conditions is paramount to our success. Wind conditions weigh heavily on our infrastructure decisions if we want a pleasurable experience for our guests. A hybrid idea of offering wind surfing as well could be examined to boost revenue streams.
